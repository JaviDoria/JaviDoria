👋🏼Hi, I’m Javi, a professional with over 20 years of experience leading teams and operations in the service industry, having held positions like restaurant manager and assistant supermarket manager. With a strong track record in leadership and a versatile skill set, I’ve decided to pursue my true passion: technology and data analysis.

👨🏻‍🎓Recently, I completed a Data Analytics Boot Camp at IT-Academy, where I developed key skills in tools like Python, MySQL, Power BI, MongoDB, and GitHub. These competencies allow me to extract, clean, transform, and visualize data to generate actionable insights. I also have a technical background in telecommunications and hands-on experience in software and hardware maintenance.

📊My strengths include critical thinking, time management, effective communication, and a strong capacity for self-learning. Paired with my leadership and organizational experience, these skills enable me to quickly adapt to tech environments and bring immediate value. I’m proficient in Catalan and English at a B1 level, and I also have basic knowledge of Portuguese, allowing me to integrate easily into multicultural teams.

👀I’m looking for an opportunity to apply my experience and analytical skills in a dynamic organization that values data-driven solutions and continuous growth.

Skills: MySql / Power Query / Power Pivot / DAX / Power BI / Tableau / Python / Pandas / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Numpy / Mongo DB / Excel
